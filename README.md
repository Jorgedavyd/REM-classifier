## New uploads:

1. Meta-learning: Meta learning is a subfield of machine learning where automatic learning algorithms are applied to metadata about machine learning experiments. As of 2017, the term had not found a standard interpretation, however the main goal is to use such metadata to understand how automatic learning can become flexible in solving learning problems, hence to improve the performance of existing learning algorithms or to learn (induce) the learning algorithm itself, hence the alternative term learning to learn.

2. RandomNeuralPopulation: Inspired by random forest architectures, the random neural population is its artificial neural network version.

Both methods could be used for all kinds of architectures:

- **RNNs**
- **LSTMs**
- **DNNs**
- **ML** low level architectures.(not recommended)
